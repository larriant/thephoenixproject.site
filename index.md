  ## The Phoenix Project
---

Confronting the climate and ecological collapse faced by our civilisation, it becomes clear that nothing less than a radical transformation of life on our planet will allow humanity to survive.

Our metaphor for this radical transformation is The Phoenix.

The Phoenix Project is our personal exploration of this transformation.

During our travels and explorations we have discovered glimmers of hope that the seeds of this transformation are already out there. Just waiting to blossom.

> “Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing.” ― Arundhati Roy

We want to document these seeds, as well as our discoveries and investigations in this newsletter.

The Phoenix Project was created by Will Franks and Julyan Davey.
