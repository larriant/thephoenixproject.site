title: Imagining The Future Workshop
---

For a few months we have been following the question of how we can give people an experience in a few hours that will open the doorway to a new way of living and being? And lay the seeds of utopianism and metamodernism?

This questioning has resulted in the Imagining the Future workshop.

The workshop is about reclaiming our ability to imagine a better world. It’s about reconnecting with imagination and vision as core driving forces of social change. 

Together we will create and explore holistic visions of the future, that touch on the emotional, intellectual, artistic, playful, contemplative, ritualistic, embodied, and social spheres. 

The workshop self-evolves in a way that allows us to actually experience new ways of living and creating.

## Schedule

We currently plan to be in the following places running the workshop:

**Brussels** (12th-16th June)

**Maastricht** (17th-18th June)

**Ende Galende Climate Camp** (19th-24th June)

**Vienna** (25th - 1st July)

**Barcelona** (2nd - 8th)

**Nowhere Festival** (9th - 14th July)

## What is our aim?

By collectively imagining new visions for the future, we can discover how to actively embody the world we want to live in. 

Each one of these workshops is unique: an experiment in collective intelligence, an artwork co-created by all who attend: including you!


## What is the context?

Our imaginations have been silenced.  We struggle to believe in the possibility of alternative lifestyles - let alone attempt living them. This is only natural: political and education systems must repress imaginations in order to create obedient economic robots. But now we are breaking free.

All this comes at a time when human extinction looms large on the horizon; a multidimensional crisis-revolution continues to explode around us and within us. At this pivotal moment in Earth’s history, how can we use imagination and vision to reach the best possible future? After all, we can only move forward as fast as we build new ideas 

## Conclusion

We can only navigate crises as well as we can conceive radically new ways of living. 

Survival through deep psychological adaptation will only be possible if we engage our meta-imaginations: our ability to imagine new ways to imagine. (That’s what we’ll attempt to do in this workshop.) 

In this way, humanity’s current challenges can be seen not just as causes for despair but as shining lights of opportunity, that a new world can be born. 

Through the process of collectively envisioning this world, we might just find we have already started creating it.


## Who are we?

Trained in fundamental physics and philosophy, Will and Julyan escaped London’s consumer dystopia to hitchhike through Europe writing poetry and philosophy, dropping in on festivals and conferences… only to return to help organise Extinction Rebellion’s radical street-occupations-cum-protest-festivals, and found a nomadic community project by squatting an empty grammar school. These experiences culminate in this innovative and experimental workshop, touted by cultural change-makers to be the “next-best-thing after a good old shamanic psychedelic ritual”.

Inspired by metamodernism: the dance between extreme enthusiasm and extreme skepticism, irony and sincerity, meaningfulness and nihilism…
