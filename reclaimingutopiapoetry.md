The following poems were co-created by groups during our [reclaiming utopia workshops](https://www.thephoenixproject.site/reclaimingutopia).


## Untitled 1
> I’m feeling quiet. Separate.  
> For a time  
> But not unnoticed  
> You are here to pick me up  
> and cast me towards the stars  
> not without coming to  
> (still quiet, still separate)  
> Both.   
> Why not both?   
> Collapse then regrowth,  
> utopia from destruction.  
> Use stillness and quietness  
> on our own actions   
> to create with right intentions.  
> Action = manifestation.  


## Untitled 2
> Give them not power but  
> Strength  
> The ability to do what’s needed  
> No capitalistic needs  
> But a meaningful purpose for  
> Activities  
> May love rule our interactions  
> Not greed  
> May we be together  
> In place and heart  
> May we gather gaia’s luscious fruits  
> And truly know the gifts we receive  
> And then, nourished, nourish in turn  
> What surrounds us with generosity
